# Research Repository - Zavala Lab
## Description
The primary purpose of this repository is to showcase all research that has been on-going on my part, with time-stamp inclusions. This is a collection of Research Articles, GitHub Repositories, and other efforts as apart of my personal research. Feel free to take a look around to understand my current/on-going efforts.

This is a repository that will be a inclusive list of everything I have done throughout the course of my PhD on the topic of Medical AI.
