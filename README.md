# Research Repository - Zavala Lab
## Description
The primary purpose of this repository is to showcase all research that has been on-going on my part, with time-stamp inclusions. This is a collection of Research Articles, GitHub Repositories, and other efforts as apart of my personal research. Feel free to take a look around to understand my current/on-going efforts.

This is a repository that will be a inclusive list of everything I have done throughout the course of my PhD on the topic of Medical AI.

## Projects
### Surgical Visual Understanding
#### Added: August 05, 2025

Contains code and implementation for the SurgVU-2025 Challenge, focusing on surgical tool detection and localization in minimally invasive surgical videos. The challenge involves creating accurate bounding box predictions for various surgical instruments across diverse surgical procedures.

Key features:
- Real-time surgical tool detection and tracking
- Multi-class bounding box prediction
- Support for various surgical instrument categories
- Evaluation metrics aligned with challenge requirements
- Pre-processing pipeline for surgical video frames

### Transformer / Vision Transformers
#### Added: August 03, 2025

Contains implementations of Vision Transformers (ViT) and standard Transformer architectures. The goal is to provide a flexible and modular codebase for experimenting with transformer-based models in computer vision tasks.

Key features:
- Configurable model parameters and architectures
- Easy-to-use training pipeline
- Implementation of both ViT and standard transformers
- Detailed documentation and examples
